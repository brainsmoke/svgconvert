Turn SVGs into KiCAD modules.

Known issues/caveats:

- Affine transformations have not been tested thoroughly.
- SVG path arcs are not supported yet, luckily SVG does not use them when editing paths,
  and converts them to cubic splines when you edit a path.
- Make sure the view port (in document->properties) is in mm.
